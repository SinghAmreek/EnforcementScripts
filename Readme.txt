These are the file I used in my Power Automate Licencing enforcement session

I have divided the scripts into 2 files 
- "PA susepension list" to the list of flow at the risk of suspension
- "App Context" to create an association between flow and the app

I used PowerShell ISE in the demo. You can select specific lines in the file and press F8 to run the selected lines.
